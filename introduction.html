      Welcome to the virtual exhibition of Exploring the Final Frontier: The
      Intersection of Culture and Science. The gallery is a collection of 3D
      models that are related to the theme of humanity's quest for scientific
      advancement and the exploration of the cosmos. The objects chosen in this
      showcase include the International Space Station (ISS), the Mars
      Exploration Rover (MER), and the Hubble Telescope. The purpose of this
      exhibit is not too explore, in-depth, the history and makings of these
      technologies. Rather, it is to understand these objects as expressing
      unique traits of human nature manifested through these technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      As humanity ventures into space, our understanding of our place in the
      universe further unravels, and the degree to which we make progress on
      these projects (or not) expresses the collective values of the human race.
      Institutions, individuals, and cultural practices support the development
      and use of space technology. Scientific inquiry, exploration, and
      collaboration are values at the heart of these projects. The development
      and funding of these projects are tied to the political and economic
      interests of the countries involved. The production of these projects
      embody and shape our shared cultural history and humanity's vision of the
      future.

      The Hubble Telescope has revolutionized our understanding of the cosmos.
      Scientists have captured stunning images of galaxies, nebulas, and other
      celestial objects, which has helped us appreciate the vastness of the
      universe and expanded our understanding of its origins and evolution. It
      reflects how little we know about the space we occupy in existence, how
      much there is to know, and how much we don't know about what we don't
      know.

      The International Space Station (ISS) is a symbol of international
      collaboration that represents the peaceful coexistences of nation states.
      It is a symbol of the potential of humanity to work together to achieve
      great things. The Mars Exploration Rover represents our desire to explore
      and understand our neighbouring planet. Is there, or was there, life on
      Mars? Recent findings suggest that there has been. If this exhibition were
      in a physical space, Virtual Reality (VR) headsets would be provided to
      allow visitors to explore every detail of the object. Instead, this
      website allows visitors to point, drag, and click through their computer
      monitors to resemble a VR experience. I find this in keeping, and in
      celebration of, the advancements of technology and its utility in our
      everyday lives. in the 21st century, technology is inextricably linked to
      human societies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Physics, computer science, and engineering now supports and enables nearly
      every aspect of human societies. Our relationships to technology can be
      clarified through the greatest feats of the scientific enterprise. Through
      these objects, we invite you to explore the ways in which culture shapes
      our understanding of space exploration and vice versa. I hope that this
      exhibition will inspire you to reflect on the relationship between science
      and our collective cultural identity that seems to be expanding into the
      depths of space.

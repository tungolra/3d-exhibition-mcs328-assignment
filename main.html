        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Welcome to the virtual exhibition of Exploring the Final Frontier:
            The Intersection of Culture and Science. The gallery is a collection
            of 3D models that are related to the theme of humanity's quest for
            scientific advancement and the exploration of the cosmos. The
            objects chosen in this showcase include the International Space
            Station (ISS), the Mars Exploration Rover (MER), and the Hubble
            Telescope. The purpose of this exhibit is not too explore, in-depth,
            the history and makings of these technologies. Rather, it is to
            understand these objects as expressing unique traits of human nature
            manifested through these technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
            As humanity ventures into space, our understanding of our place in
            the universe further unravels, and the degree to which we make
            progress on these projects (or not) expresses the collective values
            of the human race. Institutions, individuals, and cultural practices
            support the development and use of space technology. Scientific
            inquiry, exploration, and collaboration are values at the heart of
            these projects. The development and funding of these projects are
            tied to the political and economic interests of the countries
            involved. The production of these projects embody and shape our
            shared cultural history and humanity's vision of the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Hubble Telescope has revolutionized our understanding of the
            cosmos. Scientists have captured stunning images of galaxies,
            nebulas, and other celestial objects, which has helped us appreciate
            the vastness of the universe and expanded our understanding of its
            origins and evolution. It reflects how little we know about the
            space we occupy in existence, how much there is to know, and how
            much we don't know about what we don't know.
          </p>

          <p>
            The International Space Station (ISS) is a symbol of international
            collaboration that represents the peaceful coexistences of nation
            states. It is a symbol of the potential of humanity to work together
            to achieve great things. The Mars Exploration Rover represents our
            desire to explore and understand our neighbouring planet. Is there,
            or was there, life on Mars? Recent findings suggest that there has
            been.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If this exhibition were in a physical space, Virtual Reality (VR)
            headsets would be provided to allow visitors to explore every detail
            of the object. Instead, this website allows visitors to point, drag,
            and click through their computer monitors to resemble a VR
            experience. I find this in keeping, and in celebration of, the
            advancements of technology and its utility in our everyday lives. in
            the 21st century, technology is inextricably linked to human
            societies.
          </p>

          <p>
            Physics, computer science, and engineering now supports and enables
            nearly every aspect of human societies. Our relationships to
            technology can be clarified through the greatest feats of the
            scientific enterprise. Through these objects, we invite you to
            explore the ways in which culture shapes our understanding of space
            exploration and vice versa. I hope that this exhibition will inspire
            you to reflect on the relationship between science and our
            collective cultural identity that seems to be expanding into the
            depths of space.

                    Launched April 24, 1990, 11:34 UT0 at the Kennedy Space
                    Center, Fla. (USA)

                    Measures 13.2 meters long and 4.2 meters wide, with a mass
                    of 11,110 kilograms

                  The Hubble Space Telescope is made up of mirrors, cameras, and
                  scientific equipment that allows us to see as far as 13.2
                  billion light years away. It has revolutionized our
                  understanding of the universe, and has captured stunning
                  images of galaxies, nebulas, and other celestial objects. It
                  has also helped us understand the origins and evolution of the
                  universe.

                  The main body holds the main instruments that operate the
                  Hubble. The current instruments on Hubble were installed in
                  2009. The Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) allows for the resolution
                  of 0.1 arc seconds, which is 10 times better than the previous
                  WFC2

                  The unfathomable distance it can reach have challenged our
                  cultural beliefs about humanity's significance in the cosmos.
                  This technology has led to further innovations in medicine,

                  It's Solar panels (two rectangles attached to the main body)
                  are a careful innovation that produce enough power for all of
                  Hubble's instruments to operate. Its Communication antennas
                  (circular objects appended to its main body) allow digital
                  images and spectra to be transmitted to Earth.
                  <br />
                  Physicists have used data collected from Hubble to contribute
                  to the understanding of the origins of the universe. There has
                  always been pushback on these findings that go against the
                  creation myths of various cultures. Hubble continues to spark
                  debates on the subject of existentialism, subjects which
                  inform and challenge our sense of self.

                  The International Space Station (ISS) is a significant token
                  of global cooperation where collective values of
                  collaboration, scientific advancement, and exploration aligns
                  humanity.
                  <br />
                  The ISS is used for a wide range of scientific research,
                  including studies of human physiology in space, materials
                  science, and Earth observation.
                  <br />
                  The main body includes living quarters, laboratories, and
                  exercise facilities for the crew. The large solar panels on
                  each side of the body were designed and manufactured by
                  different companies around the world, including Boeing (USA),
                  Alenia Space (Europe), and Mitsubishi Electric (Japan). The
                  design and construction of these panels reflect national
                  priorities towards space exploration and scientific research.
                  Research on the ISS has had many benefits for humanity,
                  including advancing medical scanning technology, new drugs to
                  treat Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), and filtration
                  technologies that helped in the fight against COVID-19, among
                  other benefits

                  <br />
                  What the ISS makes entirely clear is the importance of
                  international cooperation to bring about feats of human
                  achievement that cannot be accomplished alone. The social
                  reality that is constructed by this international engagement
                  expresses how engagement in scientific research creates global
                  communities.

                  The Mars Exploration Rover mission received global attention.
                  It was humanity's first exploration of another planet. It
                  occupied over 11 years on the planet before shutting down. It
                  revealed evidence of liquid water on Mars, which is a key
                  ingredient for life. It also discovered evidence of ancient
                  Martian lakes and rivers, which is a significant step in
                  understanding the history of the planet<sup

                  Mars Opportunity Rover is almost animal-like in appearance,
                  with panoramic cameras for eyes, robotic appendages with claws
                  for arms and wheels for legs. It's body consists of solar
                  arrays to support its functionality and antennas to
                  communicate data back to Earth. The rover's mission was to
                  find evidence of past life on Mars. The design of Opportunity
                  entirely reflects an era of humanity's technological
                  advancement. If Opportunity were discovered by future races,
                  or aliens, they would find its design entirely peculiar and
                  belonging to a species or era not of its own. It's design is
                  an expression of a human being's sensory perceptions. It has
                  eyes to see, appendages to touch and traverse the ground it
                  stands on, ways to communicate, audio sensors to hear, and a
                  body to house its internal components.
                  <br />
                  The Rover also represents humanity's quest to expand its
                  occupation of the cosmos to other planets. Is life on Mars
                  habitable? Can we develop the technology to find out? The
                  Opportunity Rover can be seen as an early attempt of humanity
                  to answer these questions. What explorations of other worlds
                  and the global attention these projects received reveals just
                  how interested humanity is in discovering the cosmos.

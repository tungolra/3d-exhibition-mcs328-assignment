    <h2>Curatorial Strategy</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Exhibition, "Exploring the Final Frontier: The Intersection
      of Culture and Science". To ensure that visitors leave with a memorable
      and immersive experience, I have incorporated several design choices.
      Following Dean’s advice, which advocates for a “logical, sequential
      organization” in exhibitions (1994, pg. 80), the exhibit has been laid out
      linearly, with displays sorted chronologically from the date each space
      craft project began. Following the advice outlined in Wallace (2014, pg.
      5), it is essential that visitors are told a story through the chosen
      gallery artifacts. I aim to give visitors a narrative that first begins
      with wonder and curiosity, leads to collaboration and collective action,
      and finally leads to accomplishment and new discoveries.

      The exhibit starts upon entrance, where they are immediately surrounded by
      audio that resembles the mechanical sounds from a distant spacecraft,
      contributing to the mood of fascination and awe, and the feeling of
      uneasiness of being in a vast space with no known bounds. To further
      immerse the visitor into this “outer space” setting, the lighting in the
      exhibit is nearly pitch black, with only the displays and explanatory
      frames illuminated. This lighting arrangement focuses visitors’ attention
      on the objects, enhances the futuristic and otherworldy ambiance, and
      recreates the feeling of being in space.

      The objects on display are projected using a device propped up on a table,
      accompanied by VR eyewear that allows the visitors to interact with each
      object. It mimics 3D space where visitors can handle the object, while
      allowing the ability to manipulate the object’s size and viewing angles.
      Since visitors are masked with eyewear, there are no seating arrangements
      due to tripping hazards. Through VR eyewear, visitors gain the ability to
      zoom in, change the angle, and examine detailed features of each object,
      which encourages visitors’ engagement. A “real-life” experience is
      augmented through this website, which allows users to point, click, and
      drag their mouse within the display. I believe this keeps with the theme
      of how technology is embedded in our everyday lives, and sometimes even
      replaces physical realities.

      Thematic to the “futuristic” design of the exhibition is the use of
      monospace fonts which resembles texts commonly seen in sci-fi movies. The
      display text beside each exhibit object is designed to look like a virtual
      interface. Each display contains an explanation of the objects from the
      perspective of material culture. The use of VR and interactive digital
      platforms, such as websites, is taken from Blais’s “Text in the Exhibition
      Medium” (1995, pg. 6) to offer new ways of interpreting and engaging with
      material culture from exhibitions.
